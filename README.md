<H2>Hey there!ðŸ‘‹</H2> 

<p> I am <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/nimra-awan/">Nimra</a>, a Quality Assurance Engineer with 3 years of experience. I am from the land of great beauty, Pakistan.

I spent the last 3 years working for <a href="https://revivingcare.com/">RevivingCrae</a>. I started with creating documentation, designing the mobile app mockups, executing manual test cases on web and mobile apps, debugging clients' issues, training the support team, maintaining documentation, and creating automated test scripts for the stable modules.

Nowadays I have started exploring Cypress and shifting all my automation skills from Selenium to Cypress. I also love to make exciting things using CSS and HTML.

Outside of the tech world, I am a cat mom and a huge fan of exploring nature around Pakistan.</p>
